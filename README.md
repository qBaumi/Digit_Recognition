# Digit_Recognition

This is a simple perceptron in python that can take a handwritten 28x28 image and say wether it's a 0 or a 1
If you press 0 or 1 it saves the image to data.json in order to train the perceptron
If you press Space it resets the image
If you press A the AI guesses wether it is a 0 or a 1
